# Final Projects

## Announcements

* All round 1 Whiteboard interview should be done today, expect to be scheduled for round 2s later this afternoon.
* There is going to another optional lecture on "Contemporary JS Frameworks".  Gatsby / Next / Angular / Vue / Svelte. at 2:00 PM.

## Code Review

Show and tell with React Native.

* Code Review / how did the development process go.

* Robert - (Drama Echo) Stuck, cryptic errors.
  * It was working, and then for completely unknown reasons stopped.
  * Build issues.  Emulator fails when bundling, working in the browser but no where else.
  * Just at the finish but things are breaking.
  * Features: watching videos, and repeat the video content.
    * Video playing and audio recording APIs.
    * Watch the video, user records their voice.
  * Easier to follow getting started sections of APIs, libraries
  * Styles work very differently here, than in the browser.
  * Appreciate the small steps.

* Jeffrey - (Calculator App)
  * Programming with React Native isn't too bad.
  * Issues reading the documentation,
  * Lots of issues getting the simulator and emulators to work.
  * Feels like more time should have been spent on documentation and research.
  * Chasing "Moles" when building out app features.
    * Hard to know what to focus to be productive.
  * How do you make a calculator unique?
  * Just Plain old Math.
  * Going from struggling everywhere, to having a working calculator.

* Rhea - Drawing App
  * Main takeaway is this process is takes lots of time!
    * Getting the emulator working took time
    * Finding packages that work with React Native takes time, and many attempts.

* Carlos - (Pedometer - just count your steps)
  * Focus on technology that is easy to use, and not over-engineered.
  * No need to login, and create user data.

* Jordan - 1 feature or 2.
  * Canabalizing the demo.
  * Simple image storage and carousel of images.
  * Turned into a dive into research and experimentation with React Native libraries.
  * Simple theme feature, allowing the toggling of themes.
  * Attempts to copy and paste didn't work as expected.
  * Screen styling issues (one components visually consumes the other).
    * Takeaway - get a mac.
    * Jacob - maybe look into containerization (Docker).
  * 2 Days isn't enough time to get into React Native Development in depth.
